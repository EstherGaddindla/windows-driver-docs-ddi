# NdisAllocateNetBufferMdlAndData function



## -description
NDIS drivers call the 
  <b>NdisAllocateNetBufferMdlAndData</b> function to allocate a NET_BUFFER structure along with the associated
  MDL and data.



## -syntax

````
PNET_BUFFER NdisAllocateNetBufferMdlAndData(
  _In_ NDIS_HANDLE PoolHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param PoolHandle [in]

A NET_BUFFER structure pool handle that was previously returned from a call to the 
     <b>NdisAllocateNetBufferPool</b> function.


## -returns
<b>NdisAllocateNetBufferMdlAndData</b> returns a pointer to the NET_BUFFER structure that NDIS allocated.
     If the allocation was unsuccessful, this pointer is <b>NULL</b>.


## -remarks
The caller must call the 
    <b>NdisAllocateNetBufferPool</b> function and specify the maximum size of the data buffers. Given this
    value, NDIS can preallocate buffers for the caller.

This function allocates a 
    <a href="..\ndis\ns-ndis-_net_buffer.md">NET_BUFFER</a> structure, MDL and data in a single
    memory buffer. This is useful to achieve high performance when NET_BUFFER structures are frequently
    allocated and freed. The caller should not call 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisallocatenetbuffer.md">NdisAllocateNetBuffer</a> to allocate
    NET_BUFFERs out of NET_BUFFER pools which contain data.

NDIS uses the 
    <i>PoolHandle</i> parameter to get a block of memory, and then creates the NET_BUFFER, MDL, and data
    buffer.

To free the NET_BUFFER and associated information, call the 
    <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndisfreenetbuffer.md">NdisFreeNetBuffer</a> function.
